            <!-- Describing what the documentation section contains:-->
            <h1>Documentation:</h1>
            Below you can find documentation for this site and the API implemented. There is information for users on
            how to utilize the site,
            developers that are interested in how it works or might want to implement it in their own system, and also
            financial incormation for business users/users with financial interest.
            <br><br><br><br>
            <!-- Documentation information for general users:-->
            <h2>For The User:</h2>
            This site is designed to make the user experience very easy. You are able to follow the
            instructions/documentation on the page for each feature that the site implements. On both the text
            extraction page and the image description page, you will find information on how to use the feature.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>For
                    both tools/features you are able to submit a link to an image that is in a .jpg or .png format (it
                    must have
                    .jpg or .png in the url).</li><br>
                <li>These images and the link associated with them can be found on google or where
                    the image is hosted. You can right click on an image and select "Copy image address" and if that
                    link contains the correct formating as described above it will work.</li><br>
                <li>If the image
                    one you took, you can upload it to a site like "imgur.com". Once uploaded you will be able to follow
                    the same "Copy image address" step as above.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <!-- Documentation information for developers:-->
            <h2>For Developers:</h2>
            The source code for this project can be found on GitHub at the <a
                href="https://github.com/rlandgra/ITIS6177-FinalProject-ComputerVision">HERE</a>. The code is well
            documented with
            comments and is easy to replicate.
            <ul>
                <li>This site is hosted on a low cost digital ocean ubuntu linux droplet using nginx to process the
                    html, css, and
                    javascript. All of the html, css, and javascript files can be found in the "www/html" folder on
                    GitHub</li><br>
                <li>The site also utilizes javascript in combination with node in order to implement Microsoft
                    Azure's Computer Vision API. The code for the implementation of this API can be found in the server
                    folder on GitHub within the server.js file.</li><br>
                <li>As mentioned above and throughout the site Microsoft
                    Azure's Computer Vision API is necessary if this project was to be implemented elsewhere. You must
                    first have an account with Microsoft
                    Azure. Once you establish an account with the API, you can then generate a key and endpoint for the
                    API to be used for the project. For this project the key and endpoint for the API are stored in a
                    file that is only avaliable on the server side and then imported to the server.js file. This is for
                    security purposes so that it is not avaliable publicly on GitHub.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <!-- Documentation information for Business Users/Users With Financial Interest:-->
            <h2>For Business Users/Users With Financial Interest:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For the purpose of this project and to save money, I implemented it with a free trial of Microsoft
                    Azure's Computer Vision API.</li><br>
                <li>Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision API has many different, very reasonable, pricing models. </li><br>
                <li>In order to scale this project to a larger audience the server that it is hosted on would just need
                    to be upgraded which would change in price depending on scale. As far as the API, Microsoft Azure's
                    Computer Vision API
                    dynamically adjusts prices based on usage.</li><br>
                <li>Pricing models for Digital Ocean servers similiar to the one used for this project can be found <a
                        href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing">HERE</a>. Pricing models for Microsoft Azure's
                    Computer Vision API can be found <a
                        href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">HERE</a>.
